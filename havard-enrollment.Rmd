# read in the xlsx files for the spring enrollment data from 2017, 2018, and
# 2019. used mutate to add a column to each with the year, to make it easier to
# come to graph later. I also started data cleaning. for each of the years, I
# used the clean_names function from the janitor library to make the data easier
# to work with. I also filtered out any rows that did not have a result for
# course name.
