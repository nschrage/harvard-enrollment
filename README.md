# harvard-enrollment

I wanted to look at the Harvard Enrollment Data and see if anything interesting had happened over the last few years. 

I'm afraid to admit it, but I fear the snakes have won. Over the past three years, Economics has been the top department at Harvard, and participation in the dicipline has risen every year.
